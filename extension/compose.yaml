# Fleet GitOps Extension Backend Service
#
# RANCHER DESKTOP WORKAROUNDS:
# 1. Image name must be hardcoded - ${DESKTOP_PLUGIN_IMAGE} is not expanded
# 2. pull_policy: never - required for locally-built images
# 3. ports: 8080 exposed - ddClient.extension.vm.service is not implemented
#
# See docs/reference/rancher-desktop-extension-bugs.md for details

  backend:
    # IMPORTANT: This image name must match what you build with `docker build -t`
    # For development: fleet-gitops:dev
    # For production: update to match your published image name

    pull_policy: never

    # Expose HTTP port for frontend communication
    # Frontend will call http://localhost:8080/... directly
    ports:

    # Mount Docker socket to check running containers
    # Uses .raw variant as recommended for extensions in Docker Desktop VM
