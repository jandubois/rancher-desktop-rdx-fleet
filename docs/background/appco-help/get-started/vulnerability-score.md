Learn about the artifact vulnerability score


Every container image built within the Application Collection is given a score based on its latest vulnerability scan:

![Score example](images/get-started/vulnerability-score.png "Score example")

This score is a high-level objective reference which aims to simplify the interpretation of the vulnerability reports. Use this information in your decision-making.

## Decision matrix

Below you can see the decision matrix used to assign the score, the higher the better:

According to this, the lowest value matching is used. For example:

- An artifact with **no vulnerabilities** gets a **5**.
- An artifact with **1 critical**, 1 high, 6 medium and 1 low vulnerabilities gets a **1**.
- An artifact with 1 high, **6 medium** and 1 low vulnerabilities gets a **2**.
- An artifact with **1 high** and 1 low vulnerabilities gets a **3**.
- An artifact with **1 low** vulnerabilities gets a **4**.
